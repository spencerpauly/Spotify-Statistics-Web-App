# About This Project
This project was created to allow users to view a top-chart of their most listened to spotify tracks and artists. From there it grew to allow all the tracks to be downloaded into a playlist and will hopefully continue to grow to show more detailed and more informative spotify statistics to users.

## Credentials
I have removed my personal credentials from the server.js file, but if you add your own credentials and run the project, this project should be fairly easy to replicate.
